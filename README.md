## Why Identifying Design Properties Matters

Understanding the design properties of a mockup such as color styles and typography  ensures consistency, scalability, and brand identity across the entire project. By defining these properties early, developers and designers can maintain visual harmony, reduce guesswork during implementation, and speed up collaboration between design and development teams.
